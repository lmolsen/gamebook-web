Some might call you a thief, but you take umbrage with that. Really, you're doing a public service by removing potentially dangerous artifacts.",
      "The tower is tall and cylindrical, going up for many stories before ending in a pointed roof. The once-vibrant facade is now dark and choked with clinging ivy. Thick, thorny brambles circle the foot of the tower. The door in front of you is solid oak with no discernible handle or locking mechanism. Lacking in explosives as you are, you'd be unable to force your way through. ",
